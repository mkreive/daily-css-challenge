I decided to improve my HTML/CSS knowledge by taking this daily challenge: https://100dayscss.com/about.

This challenge is for those who want to improve their CSS skills. You can check every solution in codepen and compare. 
Even though I thought my knowledge in CSS was quite good, with every new task I learned new things :)
